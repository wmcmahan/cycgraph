Eval-gated learning ("verified lessons"): lessons are now retained only if runs that used them verifiably score better.

**@cycgraph/orchestrator — lesson provenance.** Retrieved memory facts can carry an `id` (`MemoryRetrievalResult.facts[].id`, optional and non-breaking). When present, the runner records which facts were injected into each node's prompt in an append-only `memory._lesson_provenance` registry (same replay-safe pattern as the taint registry; invisible to node StateViews). Voting and evolution forward provenance from every sub-agent — losing candidates count as trials too. New exports: `getInjectedFactIds(state)`, `getLessonProvenance(state)`, `getLessonProvenanceRegistry(memory)`, plus the `LessonProvenanceEntry` / `LessonProvenanceRegistry` types. Known v1 limitation: supervisor-node retrieval is not provenance-tracked.

**@cycgraph/memory — outcome ledger, retention gate, gated retrieval.** New `OutcomeLedger` interface + `InMemoryOutcomeLedger` (`recordOutcome({ run_id, score, fact_ids })`, per-fact trial stats, leave-one-out baselines). New `evaluateRetention(store, ledger, policy)` promotes `candidate`-tagged lessons that lift outcomes past `promote_margin` (tag rewritten to `verified`), soft-evicts harmful ones (`invalidated_by: 'eval-gate:harmful'`), and retires no-lift candidates at `max_trials` — including ones deadlocked on an empty leave-one-out baseline. New `retrieveGatedLessons(store, options)` fills the prompt budget verified-first with candidate exploration slots, selected in-progress-first via the ledger, with a `rest_after_trials` bench phase so fully-trialled candidates create the absence runs their baseline needs.

Runnable adversarial demo at `packages/evals/examples/eval-gated-learning/`: three deliberately poisoned lessons crater a run and the gate evicts all three on outcome evidence alone, two runs after injection.
